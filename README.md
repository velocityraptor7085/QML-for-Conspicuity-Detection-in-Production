### Project Solution:
Tasks 1-3 of the Fruanhofer QML challenge have been implemented in this project:
1. Task 1:
  - All study material was completed from the Pennylane Codebook. (https://pennylane.ai/codebook/)
  - All the codercizes from:
      1. Introduction to Quantum Computing
      2. Single Qubit Gates
      3. Circuits with Many Qubits
    were completed and their codes are visible in the "Task-1" folder.
2. Task 2:
  - The Pennylane demo on variational classifiers was read through. (https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_variational_classifier/)
  - The variational classifiers were implemented and the general workflow of variational algorithms was described.
  - Code of implementation was commented and the purpose of each step was explained thoroughly.
3. Task 3:
  - The Pennylane demo on Quanvolutional Neural Networks (QNNs) was read through (https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_quanvolution/) along with the original research paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04767)
  - The QNN for classification of handwritten digits (0-9) on the MNIST dataset was implemented and its accuracy was compared against traditional neural network methods.
  - The working and processes involved in:
      1. Data encoding
      2. Data preprocessing
      3. Circuit ansatz
      4. Quantum kernel implementation
      5. Model training and validation
    were elaborated on in detail with explanations of each line of code in the implementation.
